		<h2 id="HW"> How Computer Works </h2>
			<p> Computers are machines that handles data. They can store, receive and process information. These electrical machines are programmable and are made to execute specific instructions that are programmed. </p>
			<p> When the power is first turned on the computer, a signal is sent to the power supply and 
				electricity and voltage is sent to the computer&rsquo;s components. When the components are ready and no error signal is sent to the CPU, the CPU gets assigned a hexadecimal number that prepares it to receive instructions from the BIOS. 
				After the computer turns on, the process of booting up begins. As the user provides input; the system software tells the CPU to start up programs and hardware devices so the computer is setup to collect more input. 
				When the user makes a click on the mouse, a copy of the software program is copied into the RAM from the hard disk drive. 
				Software is the set of instructions that are coded as tasks which the computer follows with the help of the hardware and the physical components of a computer, in order to take in input and produce output.

        <h2 id="MB"> Motherboard </h2>
	<p> Important part of the computer. It holds many components of a computer. It&rsquo;s a board made of non-conductive plastic with thin layers of copper or aluminum foil printed as narrow tracks. 
	Many sockets are also made in order to hold in other components. </p>
	<p> Parts of the motherboard: </p>
	<ol> 
		<li> CPU socket that stores the CPU </li>
		<li>Fans mount next to CPU socket </li>
		<li> Power connector which distrivbutes power through the motherboard </li>
		<li> Memory slots for ram </li>
		<li>Video and graphics cards slotes such as Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)
		and Peripheral Component Interconnect Express(PCIe) </li>
		<li> Northbridge and southbridge make up the chipset
			<ul>
				<li>Southbridge controls input and output functions </li>
				<li>Northbridge forms an interface between main memory, CPU and other components </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Connectors to periperals(handled by Southbridge)</li>
		<li> ROM(read only memor also known as BIOS), with startup insturctions or firmware
			<ul>
				<li>BIOS is a non-violatile firware that give instructions during the startup process and boot the operating system </li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li> Slots to connect hardware in the form of Peripheral Component Interconnect(PCI) slots </li>
		<li> Slots for hard drives to store files </li>
	</ol>

		<h2 id="CPU"> CPU </h2>
			<p> The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is a piece of hardware on the motherboard that handles the commands from other hardware and softwares. 
				It performs the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of a computer system. The CPU is also called brain of the computer. </p>
			<p> The main parts of a CPU include: </p>
			<ol> 
				<li> The ALU that performs mathermatical and logical operations </li>
				<li> The CU that directs the processor operations </li>
			</ol>

		<h2 id="RAM"> RAM </h2>
			<p> Ram or the Random Access Memory is a computer data storage device. This type of memory is different from ROM which is “read only memory”. ROM has coded instructions on how the computer runs thus it cannot be changed. 
				It accesses data in a random order which makes it very fast to find to find a piece of information. The RAM is considered as volatile memory, meaning the information will be lost when power is off, meaning it is also “temporary memory”.
				The two main types of RAM include DRAM and SRAM. They are both volatile memories, The Static RAM is a lot faster and more expensive than Dynamic RAM. </p>

		<h2 id="FDD"> Floppy disk </h2>
			<p> Computer hardware that reads data from the disk and writes to the disk. 
			This outdated technology is now replaced with flash drives. This drive is a slot for floppy disks which a disk could be inserted and ejected. 
			Floppy drives are installed with the connection in the computer and the slot facing outside the system unit. 
			Connectors that lead to the motherboard and power supply are connected to the floppy disk drive. </p>

		<h2 id="PS"> Power supply </h2>
			<p> Power Supply Unit (PSU) a.k.a. power pack or power converter :
			This is a part of the computer which converts power from the outlet into usable power that is supplied to other parts in the system unit. 
			Power supplies usually are mounted at the back of the system unit. It converts alternate-currents to direct-currents. It stabilizes heating automatically or manually. 
			It has fans that release air out of the case. A PSU is important as the computer without power would not do any work. You would find an on and off switch on the power supply. There are also many wires that connect to the components of the computer that would need power such as fans, hard drives, etc. 
			This component&rsquo;s power is measured in watts to determine its power. Their models vary but it is never good to open the PSU. Sizes do matter in this case as they will differ between portables and desktops. </p>

		<h2 id="HDD"> Hard disk drive </h2>
			<p> The hard disk drive is the dominant non volatile data storage hardware device in a computer, and permanently stores data on the computer. 
			The hard disk drive use multiple rotating discs and rely on magnetic storage.
			Items such as the operating system, software titles and other files are stored here. </p>
			<img class="imgs" src="HardDrive.jpg" width="320" height="250" alt="This is a picture of the hard drive" >
		<h2 id="CD"> CD Drive </h2>
			<p> This device allows computers to read data off a compact disk. They cannot write data onto the disk. Microscopic bumps indicate 0 or 1 to the drive. 
				A laser moves as the disk spins to detect indentations on the disk.
				A compact disc, a flat and round disk that stores data, can be accepted and ejected from this device. </p>
			<img class="imgs" src="CD.jpg" width="320" height="250" alt="This is a picture of the CD Drive" >
		<h2 id="SC"> Sound Card </h2>
			<p> An expansion card that provides output and input audio signals. They send signals to and from the computer through the control of certain programs. 
				They have different ports such as microphone ports and digital out ports. Although many computers come with the sound card installed, they are not essential for the computer to function. </p>

		<h2 id="BT"> Voltage Regulator Module </h2>
			<p> The VRM - Voltage Regulator Module detects the amount of voltage in the microprocessor and helps it maintain a stable voltage. This is helpful when you change the microprocessor of a computer.
				In this case, the microprocessor can sense and accommodate to the new voltage level. </p>
