		<h2 id="HW"> How Computer Works </h2>
			<p> Computers are machines that handles data. They can store, receive and process information. These electrical machines are programmable and are made to execute specific instructions that are programmed. </p>
			<p> When the power is first turned on the computer, a signal is sent to the power supply and 
				electricity and voltage is sent to the computer’s components. When the components are ready and no error signal is sent to the CPU, the CPU gets assigned a hexadecimal number that prepares it to receive instructions from the BIOS. 
				After the computer turns on, the process of booting up begins. As the user provides input; the system software tells the CPU to start up programs and hardware devices so the computer is setup to collect more input. 
				When the user makes a click on the mouse, a copy of the software program is copied into the RAM from the hard disk drive. 
				Software is the set of instructions that are coded as tasks which the computer follows with the help of the hardware and the physical components of a computer, in order to take in input and produce output.

        <h2 id="MB"> Motherboard </h2>
			<p> Important part of the computer. It holds many components of a computer. It’s a board made of non-conductive plastic with thin layers of copper or aluminum foil printed as narrow tracks. 
				Many sockets are also made in order to hold in other components. </p>
			<ol>Parts of the motherboard 
				<li> CPU socket that stores the CPU </li>
				<li>Fans mount next to CPU socket </li>
				<li> Power connector which distrivbutes power through the motherboard </li>
				<li> Memory slots for ram </li>
				<li>Video and graphics cards slotes such as Accelerated Graphics Port (AGP)
					and Peripheral Component Interconnect Express(PCIe) </li>
				<li> <ul> Northbridge and southbridge make up the chipset </li>
					<li>Southbridge controls input and output functions </li>
					<li>Northbridge forms an interface between main memory, CPU and other components </li>
				</ul>
				<li>Connectors to periperals(handled by Southbridge)</li>
				<li> <ul> ROM(read only memor also known as BIOS), with startup insturctions or firmware </li>
					<li>BIOS is a non-violatile firware that give instructions during the startup process
						and boot the operating system </li>
					</ul>
				<li> Slots to connect hardware in the form of Peripheral Component Interconnect(PCI) slots </li>
				<li> Slots for hard drives to store files </li>
			</ol>

		<h2 id="CPU"> CPU </h2>
			<p> The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is a piece of hardware on the motherboard that handles the commands from other hardware and softwares. 
				It performs the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of a computer system. The CPU is also called brain of the computer. </p>
			<ol> The main parts of a CPU include:
				<li> The ALU that performs mathermatical and logical operations </li>
				<li> The CU that directs the processor operations </li>
			</ol>
